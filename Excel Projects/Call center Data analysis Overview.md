# Call Center Data Analysis Project

## **Project Objective**

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of call center data for the month of October 2020. We aim to create an interactive Excel dashboard that provides insights into call trends, customer satisfaction, call duration, and other key metrics. The dashboard will help us understand the performance and patterns within the call center and drive data-informed decisions.

## **Dataset used**
[Call center Data](https://github.com/ShomritaSingha/Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Excel%20Projects/Call%20centre%20data%20analysis%20.xlsx)

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

1. **Number of Calls:** Calculate the total number of calls made in October 2020.
2. **Average Customer Satisfaction Score:** Determine the average customer satisfaction score from the calls.
3. **Average Call Duration (in minutes):** Calculate the average duration of calls.
4. **Call Trends During October:** Visualize the trends of calls throughout the month.
5. **Call Channel Distribution:** Understand which channels were used for the calls.
6. **State Distribution:** Explore the geographic distribution of calls.
7. **Reasons for Calls:** Analyze the common reasons why customers made calls.
8. **Response Time Analysis:** Examine the response time for call handling.

## Data Analysis Process

In my journey through this call center data analysis project, I followed these steps:

###  Download and Observe Data
- I began by acquiring the dataset for call center data.
- With the dataset in hand, I proceeded to open it and carefully examine its structure.

###  Data Preparation
- To ensure data consistency and integrity, I embarked on a thorough data verification and cleaning process.
- I paid special attention to aligning data types, focusing on columns such as date, customer satisfaction score, and call duration.

###  Pivot Tables and Chart Building
- To uncover valuable insights and key performance indicators (KPIs), I created pivot tables.
- I brought the data to life by crafting a variety of charts, including line charts to visualize call trends, doughnut charts to showcase call channel distribution, a map for state distribution, a column chart to represent reasons for calls, and a bar chart to analyze response times.

###  Building the Dashboard
- I took the data analysis a step further by constructing an interactive dashboard within Excel.
- To enhance user-friendliness, I harnessed slicers, making the dashboard engaging and easy to navigate.
- Lastly, I added my personal touch by customizing the dashboard's design and layout.

These steps represent my journey of creating and analyzing this portfolio project, focusing on showcasing insights rather than providing a tutorial-like narrative.
